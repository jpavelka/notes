# Welcome!

You're reading the class notes for _IMSE 780: Methods of Operations Research_ taught at Kansas State University during the Fall 2023 semester. This course is intended to give an overview of Operations Research (OR) at the graduate level. After this course, students will have a basic familiarity with various OR methodologies and be able to recognize when the methods can be applied in real-life scenarios. Students should also be able to apply the chosen methodology via Python code.

## Course materials {#sec:materials}

The core of this course will be taught from these notes. Additionally, I encourage students to use the textbook _Introduction to Operations Research_ [@classText] as a reference[^bookVersion]. The syllabus, assignments, and other course materials may be found via the [class Canvas site](https://k-state.instructure.com/).

[^bookVersion]: The most recent version of this textbook is the 11th edition, which came out in 2021. I'm actually working from a 10th edition copy from 2015. Nothing about the course will require you to have a certain edition, or any book at all. But I think it's a very useful reference.
